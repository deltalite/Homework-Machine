# Wiki-bot

## Objective
The objective of this project is to train a chatbot that can (more or less) answer questions
surrounding wikipedia pages found in the training data. 
My personal objectives for this project are:
* To learn about NLP in Python (packages like nltk and spaCy)
* Learn more about NLP as a whole 
* Create a bot with decent answers based on questions asked

## Next steps
A simple bot contained within a script is hard to interact with, so some considerations would be:
* Create an app through which you can talk to the bot
* Use Twilio or similar service to create SMS communicating bot
* Create web scraper/use Wiki API to get additional training data, and have a bot that can expand its knowledge

### Data
The data used to train my chatbot comes from the following URL:
