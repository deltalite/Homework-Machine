# Homework Machine

## Objective
The objective of this project is to train a model to answer questions. I plan to start of with learning how to do properly interact with a pre-made model (albert) and tune it with the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). 

Steps
0. Set up pre-trained ALBERT modela and see how it works. More models can be added later.
1. Ingest `context` and `question` via string (Jupyter notebook)
2. Create logic to look up content on Wikipedia via `wikipedia` package based on question
3. Create web application implementing this same functionality
4. Integrate image uploads and OCRs for easier provision of `context` 

My personal objectives for this project are:
* Dabble in transfer learning (step 0)
* Learn techniques associated with search (step 1)
* Learn a new framework for full stack web development
* Look into ensemble learning 
* Deal with I/O of image files and OCRs
